## with regard to the origins of the samples. Thus, a metadata file must
## be provided. 

## Metadata file must be a txt or csv that contains in each column, the
## ID of the sample (#SampleID), the BarcodeSequence used for multiplexing,
## the LinkerPrimerSequence, and other parameters that you may find interesting.
## Check QIIME documentation for more information.
